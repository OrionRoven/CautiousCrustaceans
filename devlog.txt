Final Project: Scheme interpreter
2022-05-31
time spent: .5 hrs

TODO:
  * Implement prefix notation

5-25
  * Added the ability to read in Scheme from an .scm file, and formatted this text so that it's ready to be passed into the interpreter.

5-26
  * Upload flag
  * Worked on proposal
  * v0 in place

5-27
  * Worked on evaluating expressions exhibiting prefix notation
  * Got single operation expressions working

5-30
  BUG: (- 7 (+ 1 5) ) does not compile while (- 7 (+ 1 5)) does
  * Problem with spacing of parenthesis
  * Solution: Spaces are REQUIRED between every token.
  * Added the ( pass ) keyword which simply does nothing. This will be useful when we want to create conditional statements. Instead of having seperate if and if-else commands, we can just have an if-else command and do nothing if the condition is false
  TODO: evaluate multiple math expressions in the same file

5-31
  * Implemented division as it works in Java, including integer division.
  * Added floating point arithmetic
  * Created flowchart showing different states of our program
